# Git Commit Message Conventions

Commit messages are a crucial part of project history. Writing clear and consistent commits makes collaboration, debugging, and automation easier.

## üìå General Guidelines
1. **Use present tense** ‚Äî "add feature" not "added feature".
2. **Keep subject line short** ‚Äî ideally **‚â§ 50 characters**.
3. **Capitalize only the first word of the subject**.
4. **No period (.)** at the end of the subject line.
5. **Use the body** (optional) to explain *why* and *how*, not just what.
6. Separate **subject** from **body** with a blank line.

## üå± Best Practices
- One commit = one logical change.
- Don‚Äôt commit unrelated changes together.
- Use **draft commits (WIP)** locally, but squash or clean before merging.
- Agree on a convention with your team (Conventional Commits is widely used).
- Use commit linting tools like [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) for consistency.
